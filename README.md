### Environment Variables

Required environment variables for local development (`.env.local`):

```env
# Google Maps (Address Validation)
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key

# GoHighLevel Integration
GHL_CLIENT_ID=your_ghl_client_id
GHL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_ghl_client_secret

# Skip Tracing & Property Data Service
BRIDGE_API_KEY=your_bridge_key

# AI Services
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

**Production Deployment:**

For production on AWS Amplify, environment variables are handled using the official AWS approach:

1. **Set in Amplify Console**: Go to your Amplify app → App Settings → Environment variables
2. **Add all required variables** (same names as above)
3. **Build process**: The `amplify.yml` uses `env | grep` to write variables to `.env.production`
4. **Runtime access**: API routes access them via `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`

The build process automatically:
- Writes server-side variables (GHL_CLIENT_ID, API keys, etc.) to `.env.production`
- Writes all `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed variables for client-side access
- Only includes variables that actually exist in the build environment

**Security Notes:**
- Never commit actual API keys to GitHub
- Server-side variables (without `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) remain secure and server-only
- Use `.env.example` as a template for other developers
- Amplify Console variables are encrypted and only available during build/runtime

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Amplify sandbox
npx ampx sandbox

# Run development server
npm run dev
```
